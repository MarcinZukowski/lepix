Some hints:

- I/O operations add file extension and drive name if not specified ('D:').
  Example translations (when loading MIC):
  FIGHT        -> D:FIGHT.MIC
  FIGHT.PIC    -> D:FIGHT.PIC
  D:FIGHT      -> D:FIGHT.MIC
  D1:FIGHT     -> D1:FIGHT.MIC
  D1:FIGHT.MIC -> D1:FIGHT.MIC
- On program load the image memory is not cleaned.
  You can do it by pressing TAB,C,Y
- INP: to create INP from two MIC pictures load the first of them as MIC(1)
  and the second as MIC(2)
- CIN: to create a CIN picture, load a MIC picture, clear colors only and color
  the picture using the 'tone' mode

==============================================================================
ToDo:

- code review.
- mouse, lightpen support
- modules: HIP,TIP,GR8,IN8
- INP: various interlace modes: checkers, lines(, frames?)
- View mode: pressing 'V' should result in all menus disappearing
- pictures larger than 200 scanlines - up to 238 lines
  (or 119 in double-scanline modes), with main-part scrolled up/down.
  Possibly with a bar displaying the current position.
- Common file format: introduce a new file format that would support various
  graphic modes
- possibly rewrite DLIs to have per-line DLI
