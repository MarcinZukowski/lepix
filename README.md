# lepix

This is my super duper old 8-bit Atari painting program.

It's a raw dump from its Sourceforge page at https://sourceforge.net/projects/lepix/ , just copied files, did not check if it still compiles.

The website has moved to https://marcinzukowski.github.io/lepix/ .

Use at your own risk :)
